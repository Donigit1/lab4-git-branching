# Lab 4: Git Basics and Branching

## Overview

This repo contains a simple "choose your own adventure" style Python story. You will create and explore multiple branches to simulate different versions of this story.

## Your Task

You will:
1. Create two new branches: `hero-path` and `villain-path`
2. Make different story twists in each branch
3. Commit and push all changes to GitHub
4. Write a short summary of each branch here

## Branch Summaries

- `main`: Original story starter
- `hero-path`: The hero discovers a glowing sword, gains strength, and begins their journey as the chosen one.
- `villain-path`: The hero encounters a dark figure who tempts them with forbidden power; the wind warns that power has a price.

## Final Checklist

- [ ] At least 3 branches (`main`, `hero-path`, `villain-path`)
- [ ] Each branch has its own unique story version
- [ ] At least 2 commits per branch
- [ ] Changes are pushed to GitHub from EC2 or local
